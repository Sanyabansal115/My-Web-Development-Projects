# Git Workflow & Version Control Guide

This document outlines the Git workflow and version control best practices for the Sanya Bansal Portfolio project.

## 🌿 Branch Strategy

### Main Branches
- `main` - Production-ready code, deployed to live site
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/*` - Individual feature development
- `hotfix/*` - Critical bug fixes for production

### Branch Naming Convention
```
feature/component-name
feature/education-timeline
feature/contact-form
hotfix/navigation-bug
release/v1.0.0
```

## 📝 Commit Message Convention

Following conventional commit format for clear history:

### Format
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### Types
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code formatting (no functional changes)
- `refactor`: Code restructuring (no functional changes)
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding tests
- `chore`: Build process or auxiliary tool changes

### Examples
```bash
feat(education): add certification display functionality
fix(contact): resolve form validation issues
docs: update README with deployment instructions
style(css): improve responsive design for mobile
refactor(components): extract reusable navigation logic
perf(images): optimize asset loading and compression
```

## 🚀 Development Workflow

### 1. Starting New Feature
```bash
# Switch to develop branch
git checkout develop

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin develop

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-component

# Start development...
```

### 2. Regular Development
```bash
# Add changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat(component): add new functionality"

# Push to remote branch
git push origin feature/new-component
```

### 3. Feature Completion
```bash
# Merge develop into feature branch (resolve conflicts)
git checkout feature/new-component
git merge develop

# Push updated feature branch
git push origin feature/new-component

# Create Pull Request on GitHub
# After review and approval, merge to develop
```

### 4. Release Process
```bash
# Create release branch from develop
git checkout develop
git checkout -b release/v1.0.0

# Final testing and bug fixes
# Update version numbers
# Update CHANGELOG.md

# Merge to main
git checkout main
git merge release/v1.0.0

# Tag the release
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"

# Push main and tags
git push origin main
git push origin --tags

# Deploy to production
npm run deploy
```

git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-bug

# Fix the issue
# Test thoroughly

# Commit fix
git commit -m "fix: resolve critical navigation issue"

# Merge to main
git checkout main
git merge hotfix/critical-bug

# Tag hotfix
git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Hotfix version 1.0.1"

# Deploy immediately
npm run deploy

# Merge back to develop
git checkout develop
git merge main

# Clean up hotfix branch
git branch -d hotfix/critical-bug
```

### Rollback Procedure
```bash
# If deployment fails, rollback to previous version
git checkout main
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Or rollback to specific tag
git reset --hard v1.0.0

# Force push (use with caution)
git push origin main --force

# Redeploy previous version
npm run deploy
```
